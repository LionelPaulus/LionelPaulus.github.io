# Star Wars: Space Racers
As part of an intensive 4-days front-end development week at HETIC, we realized a game where your smartphone is your controller and your PC the screen.
The goal is to avoid or shoot the meteorites in order to explode them.
It is possible to play from 1 to 4 players simultaneously.
